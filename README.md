Hello I am @krisbenoit
I am interested in learning more about Firebase, Java, Python, Android App development and GitHub.
I am currently working on an Android meal planning and recipe saver app and am using Java to solve various problems for friends and families.
I am studying Java through an online course at Duke University.
